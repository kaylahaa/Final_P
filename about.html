            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h5>UCSD Student - Dolphin Trainer - Animal Enthusiast</h5>
            <p>My name is Kayla Sunshine Haas and I am currently a senior attending University of California, San Diego. My major is Marine Biology and I am very passionate about this subject. Origionally from New York, it was always my dream to live in California. I was drawn to the Pacific ocean and the creatures that lay beneath its surface. Growing up on a farm with dogs, chickens, and horses help me recognize my passion of working with animals. When I was aceppted into UCSD as a marine biology major, I knew I would finally be able to unlock my true potential. During my time as undergraduate, I was able to take many classes that allowed me to do so and expand my knowledge. I have knowledge in many STEM, writing, and computer coarses including R-studio, html, and java. I also gained lab experience in chemistry lab, marine biology lab, and cognitive science lab. While still in University, I am further persuing my goals by being an intern at both the National Marine Mammal Foundation(NMMF) and the Scripps Whale Acoustic Laboratory(SWAL). I have extensive knowledge in marine mammal husbandry and care, behavior, acoustics, and physiology. I am a hands on worker and am very dedicated to my goals. As I plan for my future, I plan to gain more experience working with animals and finding a job pertains to my knowledge and interests.</p>
